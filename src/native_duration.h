// Deliberately conservative: bails out (resolved=false) rather than guess
// on anything this simple frame walker doesn't fully understand --
// per-tag or per-frame unsynchronisation, an extended header, compressed or
// encrypted frames, or a tag_size that doesn't fit the file. Every one of
// those is rare in practice (most taggers -- Mp3tag, kid3, iTunes, foobar2000
// -- don't produce them), and callers fall back to ffprobe for exactly
// those files, so correctness never depends on this parser being complete,
// only fast for the common case.

// an unrecognized codec inside an Ogg container, a non-standard MP4 tag
// location) comes back as resolved=false so the caller falls back to
// ffprobe rather than risk a wrong or incomplete answer.
