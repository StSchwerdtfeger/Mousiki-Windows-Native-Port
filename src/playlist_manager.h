// Local-files-only playlists.
//
// A playlist is deliberately just a list of local file paths, one per
// line, saved as a plain UTF-8 .txt file -- no database, no IDs, nothing
// that can get out of sync with the filesystem. This is on purpose: it
// means a playlist file is trivially readable/editable by hand, survives
// a mousiki version bump with zero migration code, and "the playlist" IS
// the file rather than a cache of one.
//
// Deliberately does NOT support online/YouTube entries -- see the
// App-side playlist editor, which only ever lets you pick from the local
// library.
//
// Every function here is stateless: the playlists folder is passed in on
// every call (see App::playlists_dir()) rather than cached, so it always
// reflects whatever local_music_paths[0] currently is, even if that
// changes at runtime via Settings.
